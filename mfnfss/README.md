# README for the `mfnfss' bundle  (December 2017)

This "bundle" consists of a few old LaTeX2e packages written to
support some metafont based fonts within NFSS. In the early days of
LaTeX2e it was part of the required setup for LaTeX.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE 

The files in this bundle are no longer maintainted by the LaTeX Team!
So I (Frank) have picked them up to give the sources a new home, but I
do not expect to do much maintenance on them (if any).

If you actually want to use the Pandora fonts, you have to invest a a
bit of work as the fonts themselves aren't distributed these days by
most distributions because of license issues (they aren't allowed for
commercial use so aren't "free" by some standard (they are on CTAN
though, so it is possible to install them). *Please do not ask me how
to do that with your installation!*

For the old German fonts from Yannis the situation is somewhat better:
so the `oldgerm` package should work out of the box with most or
all distributions.

The file `manifest.txt` contains a list of the main files in the
distribution together with a short summary of each file.

The files are licensed under [LPPL](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
