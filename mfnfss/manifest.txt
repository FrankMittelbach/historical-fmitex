% CONTENTS OF THE MFNFSS BUNDLE
% =============================

oldgerm.dtx
        Package to typeset with old german fonts designed by Yannis
        Haralambous.  These fonts use special ligatures to access
        accented characters and may therefore need additional
        definitions if used with packages like babel or
        german.  Please don't report those kind of problems as bugs,
        we do know about it.

oldgerm.ins
        Installation script for the oldgerm package.

pandora.dtx
        Package to typeset with Pandora fonts by Nazeen N. Billawala.
